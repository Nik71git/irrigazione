## Sonoff 4ch pro R2 irrigazione

Just the basic rel 1.0 of Sonoff 4ch pro R2 with Esphome.

Below the wiring schema which preserve the old rain I-Dial controller (not smart, only manual control).
It's useful in case of failure (ðŸ˜‚) or if you dont't want to give remote control to gardeners, it provides 24VDC power suppply for valves and PSR (Pump Start Relay) too

More upgrades to code soon...
